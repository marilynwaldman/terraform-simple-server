It is a terraform for starting a simple webserver.  AWS credentials are assumed to be in $HOME/.aws

Install Terraform.
Set your AWS credentials as the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
cd into one of the two example folders.
Run terraform plan.
If the plan looks good, run terraform apply.
